   cd banana-express
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

Environment-specific configurations are set in `.env` file. This file is not available.

Create a new `.env` file, you may add the following variable the `DATABASE_URL` and `PORT` values.

## Running the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

  Variable db , create new instance Pool. Poll coming from pg.

  - connectDB test database connection on startup. Print `"database connected successfully."` if client is connected or `"database connection failed", err.message` if connection do not work.

## Database

We use [Neon](https://console.neon.tech/) with postgresql.

Set the following queries in [Neon](https://console.neon.tech/).
